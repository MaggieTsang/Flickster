# Project 1 - Flickster

The FlicksterMovieApp shows the latest movies currently playing in theaters. 
The app utilizes the Movie Database API to display images and basic information about these movies to the user.

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

* [x] Optional: Title, Backdrop Image, Overview (Landscape mode)

## Notes

Difficulties I encountered while building this app:
- Working with linear vs. relative layouts.
- Understanding the components of the Movie Adapter, from reading the data to populating the new information.
- Connecting the wifi to the emulator, Genymotion, in order to access the API.

## Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) - Image loading and caching library for Android
